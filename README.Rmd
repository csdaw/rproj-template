Template for my own reproducible research projects, using project in a folder
mentality. I  have tried the project as a package (PARP) idea and whilst it is
a good idea, it can overcomplicate things unnecessarily. 

This template uses: `git`, `renv`, `make`, and `docker`. It is based off of 
Joel Nitta's [docker-renv-example](https://github.com/joelnitta/docker-renv-example)
and Aaron Peikert's reproducible research 
[workflow-showcase](https://github.com/aaronpeikert/workflow-showcase/tree/41e7bc740a9956dea743160aac24e88165b3ec33).

## Setup

Steps taken to create this template:

1. Create a new repository on github.com. Initialise the repo with a README,
.gitignore (for R), and appropriate LICENSE.
2. In RStudio create a new project from a version control repository and paste
the repo web URL (in this case https://github.com/csdaw/rproj-template.git).
3. Open this project folder with your local R installation or IDE, or even 
mount it to a containerised development environment.
4. Develop your analyses. In this case there is just a single representative 
Rmarkdown document which knits to pdf and produces 2 figures.
5. Copy the `Dockerfile`, `install_packages.R` and `renv_restore` from 
[docker-renv-example](https://github.com/joelnitta/docker-renv-example) to this
folder.
6. Modify the install_packages.R script to suit the specific project requirements.
7. Launch a container with the specific R version that you want and with 
   the project folder mounted, using the 
   following command (Be sure to replace the path on the left side of : 
   (`~/repos/docker-renv-example/`) with the path to the project folder on your 
   machine):
   
```docker run -it -e DISABLE_AUTH=true -v ~/repos/rproj-template/:/home/rstudio/project rocker/verse:4.0.0 bash```

8. This will open a bash shell within the container. Navigate to the mounted 
   project folder within the container:
   
```cd home/rstudio/project```

9. Run the install_packages.R script within the container (this may take a 
   while depending on the number of packages that are installed from source):

```Rscript install_packages.R```

10. Exit the container with using `exit`. The `install_packages.R` script has
    generated the following files and directories:
    - renv.lock
    - .Rprofile (modified if it already existed)
    - renv/activate.R
    - Various other files in renv/ that should not be commited
11. Commit the renv files above.
